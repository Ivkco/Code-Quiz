# Unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a code quiz with multiple-choice questions.


## Instructions

From scratch, build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side. Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


## Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with README describing project.

* The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.

* Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.

* Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

* If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.

* The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

* After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
